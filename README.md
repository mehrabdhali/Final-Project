■ The project’s purpose and functionality.
The project’s purpose and functionality are to provide a daily analysis of cryptocurrencies. Currently, cryptocurrency prices are rising at an increasing rate, for example, Bitcoin recently hit the 100K mark. For this project, we chose cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin to heavily study their growth in price and volume. The purpose is for people to invest in cryptocurrencies by looking at daily analyses and seeing cryptocurrency as a promising future investment. The algorithm we made, functions to fetch the data from Polygon.io and we made visualizations based on the data we got for the current year, which we looked at from January to December. 

■ Instructions on how to install dependencies and run the project.
- Make sure to have an API key from Polygon.io to run it. 
- You can change the ticker to the cryptocurrency you want to focus on or use the fetch_crypto_data function to add as many cryptocurrencies as you want to combine all data in a single data frame. This will allow you to play around with the visualizations using the cryptocurrency you want.
- Be sure to identify the right ticker from Polygon.io using this link. Run the query to find the ticker available.

■ A description of the API(s) used and data visualizations created.
The API we used is Polygon.io. Polygon.io provides real-time market data for stocks and cryptocurrencies, offering the endpoints to retrieve this type of data. We created multiple data visualizations, two data visualizations per crypto. We used scatter plots, box plots, histograms, line graphs, etc. to clearly analyze the cryptocurrencies and give a better analysis through our visualization.
